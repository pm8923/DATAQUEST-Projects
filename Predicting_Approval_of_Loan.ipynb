    "Once the data is all clean, it is important to decide and error metric for the  model. It is important to note that the loans dataset presents a class imbalance. There are 6 times as many loans that were payed off on time (1's) as there were loans that weren't paid off (0's). This implies that a classifier can predict 1 for a row and have high accuracy. Therefore, accuracy is not a proper metric to use to assess the strength of our model. Rather, our model should optimize towards a high true positive rate (the number of predictions that were correct) and a low false positive rate (number of predictions that were 1's but should have been 0's), so that an investor has less chances of losing money.
